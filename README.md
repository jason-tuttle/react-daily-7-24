# REACT DAILY PROJECT - 7/24-2017

###### This project will provide practice in scaffolding, passing props, passing functions as props, and rendering child components.

The application should run without errors and you should be able to input text and display it in another component after clicking submit. After all functionality is complete you should stylize your application in a theme that you see fit.
